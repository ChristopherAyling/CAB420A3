## Objective 

To explore the the performance of different machine learning algorithms and architectures in
completing tasks of categorizing images of classes they have never seen before.

## Dataset Info

The data used to train and evaluate the algorithms will be a subset of the Caltech256 dataset
(http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/details.html)

The subset contains 8 classes of water animals, 11 classes of air animals and 23 classes of
land animals. Each of these classes contains a minimum of 80 images each.
