## Objective 

To explore the the performance of different machine learning algorithms and architectures in
completing tasks of categorizing images of classes they have never seen before.

Various CNN architectures as well as clustering methods will be implemented.
The results of these will be analysed to see how each method learns and how
well they can generalise to broad classes.

Techniques such as transfer learning will be integrated with the aim of
improving accuracy.

## Dataset Info

The data used to train and evaluate the algorithms will be a subset of the Caltech256 dataset
(http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/details.html)

The subset contains 8 classes of water animals, 11 classes of air animals and 23 classes of
land animals. Each of these classes contains a minimum of 80 images each.
