## Objective 

To explore algorithms to fulfill the task of discriminating between different forms of animals.
These forms are land, air and water.

This task is expected to be challenging as the model will need to learn to generalize the high
variety in each set of classes.

Interesting experiments that may be completed include testing if the model can correctly identify
not just images it hasn't seen before, but classes it hasn't seen before too.

## Dataset Info

The data used to train and evaluate the algorithms will be a subset of the Caltech256 dataset
(http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/details.html)

These subset contains 8 classes of water animals, 11 classes of air animals and 23 classes of
land animals. Each of these classes contains a minimum of 80 images each.
